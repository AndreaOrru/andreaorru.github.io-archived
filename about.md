My name is Andrea and I'm a computer programmer. In a [different life](http://wildjourney.net), I'm an insatiable traveller.

I have been playing around with programming since I put my hands on my first computer in primary school. I started off writing small games and worked my way up to system programming in C/C++ during high school.
I went on to study Computer Science in college, then a Master in Intelligent Systems where I worked on biologically-inspired constructive neural networks for Computer Vision.

I founded my own startup right after, built a MVP and managed to raise pre-seed funding. The product didn't work out in the end, but the entrepreneurship skills I developed allowed me to become part of [Rokk3r Labs](http://rokk3rlabs.com), where I helped co-building other startups as a full-stack developer.

I quit my job to join the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), the best programming community in the world, where I'm pursuing my interests in system programming, functional paradigm, language design, compilers and reverse engineering.
