*Creation happens when the pain of not doing outweights the pain of doing.*

I reached that point at exactly half of my batch at the **[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com)**. In case you don't know about it, let me give a brief introduction. In essence, RC is a 3 months coding retreat based in New York, and the best programming community in the world. But that doesn't even begin to describe it. RC is more like Heaven on Earth. **The Nirvana of programmers**. If you are serious about becoming great, you should [apply now](https://www.recurse.com/apply). Really.

I always found that the quoted definition of *infornography* (mutuated from the excellent cyberpunk anime [Serial Experiments Lain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain)) resonates with me very much. However, it's only now that, overwhelmed by the inspiration this place has filled me with, I decided to start this blog, to have a chance to talk about the topics that fascinate me the most. **Hopefully you'll find some of them interesting too.**
